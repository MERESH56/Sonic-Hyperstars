# Sonic-SuperXO
## Hi, and welcome to this repository
This is a repo for something I've planned to do. It's a 2.5D Classic Sonic fangame. I've not decided its name yet, but I'm thinking about names like Sonic Super XO (I know it may seem a kinda weird name) which stands for "Sonic Super Extended Orion (strange, isn't it?), or Sonic OrionX, or maybe simply Sonic Hyperstars, or just Sonic Superstars 2, or Sonic Mania 2 (tell me which name you like and the codename I should choose for this project, in the Discussions. Btw, please join the Discussions cuz I am alone here).

## When did I start thinking about it
The first time I decided to think about it when I imagined a Sonic Mania fangame with full moveset. This idea developed when I saw the success of Super Mario Bros. Wonder against Sonic Superstars, which led me to ask if Super Mario Bros. Wonder had some Sonic style in it, like sonic and his friends wall climbing (like in Sonic USB Online) and stomping (like Modern Sonic) and having interactive elemental shields and so on. So I decided to make a classic sonic 2.5D fangame with Super Mario Bros. Wonder Graphics and (sort of) some creative ideas. Some of the ideas may be a ripoff of Super Mario Bros. Wonder (as I'm afraid), but I just wanna get some ideas on my own.

## Moveset
This game may feature some different options, like having 3 types of movements, like basic moveset (the classic one, of course, with sonic having a dropdash), some Super Mario Bros. Wonder moveset (with sonicy style, such as stomping (you know what I mean about stomping, It's just a modern Sonic style of stomping that you know) and wall climbing (Inspired by Sonic USB Online)) and the full customisable moveset (basically, a wide variety of different customisable abilities, a few examples for Sonic like: Air Recurling from Sonic Triple Trouble, Super Peel-Out (basically, from Sonic CD), Insta-Shield (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, also it would be cool if it was reimagined in 3D), Instant Spin-Dash (from Sonic Generations) and so on...).

## Characters
The character cast will include 7 playable characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Mighty, Ray and finally, Trip. I'm still thinking about adding Fang to the playable cast.

## Ideas and Features
I had some ideas that I think may inspire me to make some new gimmicks, they're written on my Notes app (Samsung Notes, since I own a Samsung device). Some of these ideas are for example: QTEs like those in Modern Sonic games, springs and boostpads to keep some momentum and flow (some would become used in funny ways, especially in loops üòÅ), Variable Autoscrolling Speed (like in Tails' Skypatrol, and trust me, this way to play autoscrolling levels is gonna be fun and challenging), and the Dynamic Camera feature from Sonic Generations, Extended Camera from Sonic CD, Photo Mode (for taking screenshots), Day and Night Mode in Title Screen (which changes the music by instruments), multiple island view modes on the level select menu (all islands together in one view, one full island, isometric view and traditional 3D view)and DA Garden rhythm game, Pinch Mode for bosses, and also some neat secrets üòâ.

## Story
I haven't thought of a plot yet, since I focused on gameplay while thinking of this game. So, I'm going to write the plot in the Discussions section when I figure it out.

## Zones
And speaking about the zones, I think about some of my favourite obscure zones in the entire Classic Sonic series. I'm planning for Emerald Hill Zone, Starlight Zone, Bridge Zone, Sunset Park Zone, Diamond Dust Zone, Lava Reef Zone, Hidden Palace Zone (from Sonic 3&K, not Sonic 2), Sandopolis Zone, Underground Zone, Tidal Tempest Zone, Quartz Quadrant Zone, Aquatic Ruin Zone, Crystal Egg Zone and Sky Chase Zone. Or, maybe I'll plan for new ones, for example, I've recently planned on a final zone called Egg Palace Zone. It will feature mirrors utilised in a very stange way (and a lot of sonics and stuff), speed sections (maybe like rainbow roads but not with rainbow colors exactly) as well as platforming sections (maybe I'll look for something like this in Silver Castle Zone from Sonic Blast, sorry üòÖ) some real royal palace vibes mixed with some factory machinery, and a final boss with all the zone's elements.

## Multiplayer
Multiplayer, tho, I plan for a normal local multiplayer, but maybe there will be an online multiplayer, although I don't think so (idk why).

## Engine and Framework
And the engine I'm gonna use, maybe I will use the Dash Engine, or Infinity Engine, or the Bumper Engine, or maybe I will make my own 2.5D Engine and post a repo for it separately as soon as I release this game.

## Progress
I haven't started making it yet, tho. But I'll maybe start it some other time.


As you see, this is a humble and very long readme file with megabytes of storage and nothing very special, so if you ever want to contribute to this repo, please teach me some github basics as well as writing markdown files like this, Thanks for reading it, btw.
