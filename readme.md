# Sonic Hyperstars
## Hi, and welcome to this repository
This is a repo for something I've planned to do. It's a 2.5D Classic Sonic fangame called ___Sonic Hyperstars___. I've not decided its codename yet, but I'm thinking about names like Sonic SuperOrion or Sonic OrionX, or maybe simply Sonic Superstars 2 (tell me which codename I should choose for this project, in the Discussions. Btw, please join the Discussions cuz I am alone here).

## When did I start thinking about it
The first time I decided to think about it when I imagined a Sonic Mania fangame with full moveset. This idea developed when I saw the success of Super Mario Bros. Wonder against Sonic Superstars, which led me to ask if Super Mario Bros. Wonder had some Sonic style in it, like sonic and his friends wall climbing (like in Sonic USB Online) and stomping (like Modern Sonic) and having interactive elemental shields and so on. So I decided to make a classic sonic 2.5D fangame with Super Mario Bros. Wonder Graphics and (sort of) some creative ideas. Some of the ideas may be a ripoff of Super Mario Bros. Wonder (as I'm afraid), but I just wanna get some ideas on my own.

## Moveset
This game may feature some different options, like having 3 types of movements, like basic moveset (the classic one, of course, with sonic having a dropdash), some Super Mario Bros. Wonder moveset (with sonicy style, such as stomping (you know what I mean about stomping, It's just a modern Sonic style of stomping that you know) and wall climbing (Inspired by Sonic USB Online)) and the full customisable moveset (basically, a wide variety of different customisable abilities, a few examples for Sonic like: Air Recurling from Sonic Triple Trouble, Super Peel-Out (basically, from Sonic CD, or maybe replace it with the Strike Dash from Sonic Chaos), Insta-Shield (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, also it would be cool if it was reimagined in 3D), Instant Spin-Dash (from Sonic Generations) and so on...).

## Characters
The character cast will include 7 playable characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Mighty, Ray, and finally, Trip. I'm still thinking about adding Fang to the playable cast.

## Ideas and Features
I had some ideas that I think may inspire me to make some new gimmicks, they're written on my Notes app (Samsung Notes, since I own a Samsung device). Some of these ideas are for example: QTEs like those in Modern Sonic games (Like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Generations) and Sonic 3 & Knuckles (like in Lava Reef Act 1, and well, chasing sequences), springs and boostpads to keep some momentum and flow (some would become used in funny ways, especially in loops üòÅ), Variable Autoscrolling Speed (like in Tails' Skypatrol, and trust me, this way to play autoscrolling levels is gonna be fun and challenging), and the Dynamic Camera feature from Sonic Generations (and maybe Sonic Generations' after-images used for Classic Sonic), Extended Camera from Sonic CD, Photo Mode (for taking screenshots), Day and Night Mode in the level select menu (which changes the instrumentation of the music), multiple island view modes on the level select menu (all islands together in one view (only when you have the level pack DLC, or when you finish Lava Reef Zone and Hidden Palace), one full island, isometric view and traditional 3D view) and DA Garden rhythm game, Pinch Mode for bosses (oh man, the bosses need some work, especially with the multiplayer), and also some neat secrets üòâ.
I am also planning to add a mod about this fangame to Sonic Superstars once it releases, and maybe a Super Mario Bros. Wonder, because why not üòÅ?

## Story
I haven't thought of a plot yet, since I focused on gameplay while thinking of this game. So, I'm going to write the plot in the Discussions section when I figure it out.

## Zones
And speaking about the zones, I think about remixing some of my favourite obscure zones in the entire Classic Sonic series, including the 8-bit games, as well as adding original zone concepts. The zones between parentheses are the zones that inspire the new ones. Those zones are:  
  
1-Diamond Peak Zone       (Emerald Hill Zone & Green Hills Zone)  
  
2-Skyhigh Bridge Zone     (Bridge Zone)  
  
3-Mineral Unders Zone     (Quartz Quadrant Zone & Underground Zone)  
  
4-Mirage Dunes Zone       (Sandopolis Zone)  
  
5-Coral Blades Zone       (Tidal Tempest Zone & Aquatic Ruin Zone & Marble Garden Zone & Rusty Ruin Zone)  
  
6-Glitter Dust Zone       (Diamond Dust Zone)  
  
7-Sakura Petals Zone      (Press Garden Zone Act 2)  
  
8-Lava Reef Zone          (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, not original)  
  
9-Hidden Palace Zone      (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, not Sonic 2, not original)  
  
10-Twilight Rails Zone    (Sunset Park Zone)  
  
11-Shining Nexus Zone     (Starlight Zone & Gigalopolis Zone (or Gigapolis Zone))  
  
12-Mecha Rainforest Zone  (Mecha Green Hill Zone)  
  
13-Binary Circuit Zone    (Cyber Station Zone)  
  
14-Celestial Stars Zone   (Crystal Egg Zone)  
  
15-Egg Citadel Zone       (totally original)  
  
16-Sky Chase Zone         (or maybe put it as a separate act in another zone).  
  
## Multiplayer
Multiplayer, tho, I plan for a normal local multiplayer, but maybe there will be an online multiplayer, although I don't think so (idk why). But a lot of online fangames, like Sonic USB Online, encourage me to put online co-op, and also I am going to integrate competition mode (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles) and battle mode from Sonic Superstars, into one full battle mode, you can chose between normal characters and your customisable bots, as well as the ability to choose the stage you want by voting. Battle mode will also be compatible with the level pack DLC, so you're able to choose between the additional levels, too. You can also have teams in battle mode, so you're able to choose between two-team competitions and four-tag-team competitions. My ideas for improving Sonic Superstars co-op is going to be in the Discussions section.

## Engine and Framework
And the engine I'm gonna use, maybe I will use the Dash Engine, or Infinity Engine, or the Bumper Engine, or maybe I will make my own 2.5D Engine and post a repo for it separately as soon as I release this game.

## Progress
I haven't started making it yet, tho. But I'll maybe start it some other time.


As you see, this is a humble and very long readme file with megabytes of storage and nothing very special, so if you ever want to contribute to this repo, please teach me some github basics as well as writing markdown files like this, Thanks for reading it, btw.
