# Sonic-SuperXOo
## Hi, and welcome to this repository
This is a repo for something I've planned to do. It's a 2.5D Classic Sonic fangame. I've not decided its name yet, but I'm thinking about names like Sonic SuperXO (I know it may seem a kinda weird name) which stands for "Sonic Super Extended Orion" (strange, isn't it?), or Sonic OrionX, or maybe simply Sonic Hyperstars, or just Sonic Superstars 2, or Sonic Mania 2 (tell me which name you like and the codename I should choose for this project, in the Discussions. Btw, please join the Discussions cuz I am alone here).

## When did I start thinking about it
The first time I decided to think about it when I imagined a Sonic Mania fangame with full moveset. This idea developed when I saw the success of Super Mario Bros. Wonder against Sonic Superstars, which led me to ask if Super Mario Bros. Wonder had some Sonic style in it, like sonic and his friends wall climbing (like in Sonic USB Online) and stomping (like Modern Sonic) and having interactive elemental shields and so on. So I decided to make a classic sonic 2.5D fangame with Super Mario Bros. Wonder Graphics and (sort of) some creative ideas. Some of the ideas may be a ripoff of Super Mario Bros. Wonder (as I'm afraid), but I just wanna get some ideas on my own.

## Moveset
This game may feature some different options, like having 3 types of movements, like basic moveset (the classic one, of course, with sonic having a dropdash), some Super Mario Bros. Wonder moveset (with sonicy style, such as stomping (you know what I mean about stomping, It's just a modern Sonic style of stomping that you know) and wall climbing (Inspired by Sonic USB Online)) and the full customisable moveset (basically, a wide variety of different customisable abilities, a few examples for Sonic like: Air Recurling from Sonic Triple Trouble, Super Peel-Out (basically, from Sonic CD, or maybe replace it with the Strike Dash from Sonic Chaos), Insta-Shield (from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, also it would be cool if it was reimagined in 3D), Instant Spin-Dash (from Sonic Generations) and so on...).

## Characters
The character cast will include 7 playable characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Mighty, Ray, and finally, Trip. I'm still thinking about adding Fang to the playable cast.

## Ideas and Features
I had some ideas that I think may inspire me to make some new gimmicks, they're written on my Notes app (Samsung Notes, since I own a Samsung device). Some of these ideas are for example: QTEs like those in Modern Sonic games (Like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Generations) and Sonic 3 & Knuckles (like in Lava Reef Act 1, and well, chasing sequences), springs and boostpads to keep some momentum and flow (some would become used in funny ways, especially in loops üòÅ), Variable Autoscrolling Speed (like in Tails' Skypatrol, and trust me, this way to play autoscrolling levels is gonna be fun and challenging), and the Dynamic Camera feature from Sonic Generations (and maybe Sonic Generations' after-images used for Classic Sonic), Extended Camera from Sonic CD, Photo Mode (for taking screenshots), Day and Night Mode in the level select menu (which changes the instrumentation of the music), multiple island view modes on the level select menu (all islands together in one view (only when you have the level pack DLC, or when you finish Lava Reef Zone and Hidden Palace), one full island, isometric view and traditional 3D view) and DA Garden rhythm game, Pinch Mode for bosses (oh man, the bosses need some work, especially with the multiplayer), and also some neat secrets üòâ.
I am also planning to add a mod about this fangame to Sonic Superstars once it releases, and maybe a Super Mario Bros. Wonder, because why not üòÅ?

## Story
I haven't thought of a plot yet, since I focused on gameplay while thinking of this game. So, I'm going to write the plot in the Discussions section when I figure it out.

## Zones
And speaking about the zones, I think about remixing some of my favourite obscure zones in the entire Classic Sonic series, including the 8-bit games. I'm planning for:
1-Emerald Hill Zone
2-Starlight Zone
3-Bridge Zone
4-Sunset Park Zone
5-Diamond Dust Zone
6-Rusty Ruins Zone
7-Lava Reef Zone
8-Hidden Palace Zone (from Sonic 3&K, not Sonic 2)
9-Sandopolis Zone
10-Marble Garden Zone
11-Underground Zone
12-Gigalopolis Zone (or Gigapolis)
13-Tidal Tempest Zone
14-Quartz Quadrant Zone
15-Aquatic Ruin Zone
16-Crystal Egg Zone and Sky Chase Zone (or maybe put it as a separate act in another zone). Or, maybe I'll plan for new ones, for example, I've recently planned on a semi-final zone called Egg Citadel Zone. It will feature mirrors utilised in a very strange way (and a lot of sonics and stuff), speed sections (maybe like rainbow roads but not with rainbow colors exactly) as well as platforming sections (maybe I'll look for something like this in Silver Castle Zone from Sonic Blast, sorry üòÖ) some real royal palace vibes mixed with some factory machinery, and a final boss with all the zone's elements.

## Multiplayer
Multiplayer, tho, I plan for a normal local multiplayer, but maybe there will be an online multiplayer, although I don't think so (idk why).

## Engine and Framework
And the engine I'm gonna use, maybe I will use the Dash Engine, or Infinity Engine, or the Bumper Engine, or maybe I will make my own 2.5D Engine and post a repo for it separately as soon as I release this game.

## Progress
I haven't started making it yet, tho. But I'll maybe start it some other time.


As you see, this is a humble and very long readme file with megabytes of storage and nothing very special, so if you ever want to contribute to this repo, please teach me some github basics as well as writing markdown files like this, Thanks for reading it, btw.
